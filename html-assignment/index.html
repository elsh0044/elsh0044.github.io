    <article>About Me</article>
    <p>Hi my name is Ali, i am 22 years old. I have two siblings and I am the oldest. One of my favoutite hobbies is watching and playing soccer, My favorite team is liverpool and one of my favourite players is Mo Salah. I moved from <em>Egypt</em> on July 16<sup>th</sup> 2019 to <em>Canada</em>. I really liked it here, I found countless oportunities and I am grateful being here.</p>
    <p>Being the oldest brother, I always knew that i had to show up and be a role model for my younger Brothers. One of my biggest dream was to be a professional soccer player, and I always wanted to have my last name on the back of the shirt. I switched from <abbr title="Business Administration Core">BAC </abbr>to <abbr title="Inetractive Media And Design">IMD</abbr>, and I am really happy with this program, its very fast paced and its packed with new skills.</p>
    <p>One of my favourite quotes is: <blockquote>Its so easy to be great nowadays because everyone else is weak. -<cite>David Goggins</cite></blockquote></p>
